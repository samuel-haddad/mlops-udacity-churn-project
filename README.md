# Predict Customer Churn

**Course:** ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
This is a project to implement best coding practices. For that, I should prove my skills for testing, logging and best coding practices on the implementation of a pre-developed machine learning model. I was supposed to:
1. Refactor the model code and create a python file.
2. Create a test and log file
3. Give a good description of the project, so anyone should be able to run the code by reading this README.

## Files and data description

<p style="text-align: center"><img src=".\images\churn_project_dir.png"  width="300"/></p>

**Data**
<br>Churn database from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers/data)

**Images**
- EDA: data explore outputs
- Results: models outputs

**Logs**
<br> Text file with Logging and Tests report

**Models**
Logistic Regression and Random Forrest models (.plk files)

**Guide**
<br> Notebook with project general instructions

**churn_notebook.ipynb**
<br> Python Notebook with the code to be refactored

**churn_library.py**
<br> Library of functions to find customers who are likely to churn.

**churn_script_logging_and_tests.py**
<br> Contain unit tests for the churn_library.py functions. It also logs any errors and INFO messages.

## Running Files
How do you run your files? What should happen when you run your files?

To run the complete script with logging and tests just paste on terminal:

    ```$ ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests_solution.py```

Or if you just want to run the library:

    ```$ ipython churn_library.py```
